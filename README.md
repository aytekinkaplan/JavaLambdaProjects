## Practice Project: Exploring ArrayList Functionalities

This project aims to explore various functionalities of ArrayLists in Java. The goal is to solidify the fundamentals of working with ArrayLists and enhance practical programming skills.

**Tasks:**

**1. Calculating Average:**

* Utilize iteration to compute the mean of integers in an ArrayList
* Gain hands-on experience with iteration and arithmetic operations in Java

**2. Finding Minimum and Maximum Values:**

* Leverage the powerful `Collections.min()` and `Collections.max()` methods for efficient retrieval
* Gain practical knowledge of Java Collection methods

**3. Implementing Number Search:**

* Develop a robust algorithm to locate specific integers within the ArrayList
* Enhance understanding of conditional statements and search techniques in Java

**4. Sorting Elements:**

* Master the `Collections.sort()` method to arrange ArrayList elements in ascending or descending order
* Explore sorting algorithms and their applications in Java

**5. Eliminating Duplicates:**

* Utilize Sets to retain only unique values within the ArrayList
* Deepen knowledge of different data structures and their purposes

**6. Embracing Flexibility:**

* Modify the code to gracefully handle varying numbers of user inputs
* Build adaptability and user-centric design into Java solutions

**Project Flow:**

1. Implement each task in a separate Java class
2. In each class, add a test method demonstrating the task's functionality
3. Organize your code in a repository on GitHub
4. Provide detailed explanations and code examples in a README file for each task

**Learning Objectives:**

* Solidify the fundamentals and functionalities of ArrayLists
* Gain practical experience with iteration, collections, algorithms, and data structures in Java
* Develop clean and readable coding skills
* Learn to version control and manage your code using GitHub
